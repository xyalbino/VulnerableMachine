This is a vulnerable lab challenge for the starters. If you are a big fan of westworld, you might be familiar with the flags. To complete this challenge, you need to achieve ten flags which contains some useful clues. The ultimate goal is to find and read the flag in the windows machine. You will require Linux skills and basic knowledge about web vulnerabilities, reverse engineering and password cracking.

This lab contains two vulnerable machines: Ubuntu 18.04.2 & Windows XP Professional. The OVAs have been tested on VMware Workstation and VMware Fusion.

Hint: You should start the challenge from the Ubuntu machine. Enjoy your hacking :)
